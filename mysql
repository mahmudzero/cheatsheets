mysql client is just `mysql`, first thing to try is `mysql -u root -p` which'll prompt for password

mysql-client is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because it conflicts with mysql (which contains client libraries).

If you need to have mysql-client first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql-client you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/include"

For pkg-config to find mysql-client you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib/pkgconfig"
