mysql client is just `mysql`, first thing to try is `mysql -u root -p` which'll prompt for password

mysql-client is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because it conflicts with mysql (which contains client libraries).

If you need to have mysql-client first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql-client you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/include"

For pkg-config to find mysql-client you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib/pkgconfig"

## LATEST
We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:
    mysql -u root

mysql@8.0 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have mysql@8.0 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@8.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql@8.0 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@8.0/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@8.0/include"

For pkg-config to find mysql@8.0 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@8.0/lib/pkgconfig"

To start mysql@8.0 now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql@8.0
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@8.0/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/opt/homebrew/var/mysql
